ColorPickerPopover
==================

Lightweight Color Picker inside NSPopover.

## Installation (CocoaPods)
Configure your Podfile to use `ColorPickerPopover`:

```pod 'ColorPickerPopover', :git => 'https://github.com/OskarGroth/ColorPickerPopover.git'```

(Some Swift3 issues are preventing me from uploading to Cocoapods for now.)
Note that this repo is Swift 3 only.

## Usage

Create an `NSColorWell` in Interface Builder and set it's class to `ColorWell`.

Set its delegate to your view controller or other class.

Implement the delegate method:

    func colorDidChange(colorWell: ColorWell, color: NSColor)
    
This popover only shows a single color picker (defaulting to Color Wheel).

You can change the color picker by changing:

        let paletteItem = colorPanel?.toolbar?.items[0]
        
To other color palette item indexes.

If you want to show a true color panel (with the toolbar and all the options), it should be straightforward to extend this project and implement the toolbar manually. If you do, please send me a pull request.
